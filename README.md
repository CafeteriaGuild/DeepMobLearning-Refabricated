Deep Mob Learning: Refabricated is a parallel version of Deep Mob Learning Minecraft Mod (originally authored by [IterationFunk](https://github.com/xt9/DeepMobLearning)) made to Fabric Mod Loader.

While IterationFunk's Deep Mob Learning focused much more on acquiring mob loot, our rendition takes liberties to expand and modernize the mod, while retaining its essence intact.

## Will there ever be a (Neo)Forge version?
**Well yes but actually no.** If you want a Forge version of this mod you should check out either [IterationFunk's version (1.12)](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/deep-mob-learning) or Shadows_of_Fire's [Hostile Neural Networks (1.16+)](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/hostile-neural-networks), another IterationFunk-sanctioned rendition of the original mod's concepts.

About Deep Mob Learning: **Refabricated**, unfortunately we don't plan to support (Neo)Forge. But if you want to, take some words with us at [Cafeteria](https://discord.com/invite/G4PjhEf) and [the original author of the mod](#IterationFunks-version) and you should be fine.

## Setting up dev env
The only special thing that differs from a gradle project is that you will need to have this section in your ``~/.gradle/gradle.properties`` file:

```
mcdUsername=foo
mcdPassword=bar
curseforgeToken=foobar
```

The values can be dummy, fill with the right ones if you somehow need to do the publications.

## Contact
If you want to **report bugs**, give ideas, **feedbacks** or discuss the mod at all, feel free to open an Issue or join our [Discord Guild](https://discord.com/invite/G4PjhEf) and go to the Deep Mob Learning: Refabricated section. Please note that this guild is a shared place where me and some friends are making mods, take a look at their mods too!
